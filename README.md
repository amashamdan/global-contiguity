###National Contiguity Force Graph (under construction)

A D3.js-created force-chart showing how all countries in the world share borders with each other.

Each link (line) coming out of a country (node) represents a shared border with country at the end of that link.

The user drag a country around without breaking any link. 

Enjoy!
